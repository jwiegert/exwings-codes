# A local API for more easily explore the data within r3dresults.

# As of now, my results are only from various tests. But in the future there
# will be a lot of data, a lot of simulated images and SEDs, all in various
# viewing angles, resolutions etc etc. For this reason I need a much more
# convenient way of looking at these. As such I designed this simple API that I
# only run locally, to much faster look at results and inter-compare results.
